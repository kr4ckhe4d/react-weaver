# **App Name**: React Weaver

## Core Features:

- Component Library: Display a list of available Material UI (MUI) components in a left sidebar.
- Drag and Drop: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for adding components to the canvas.
- Snap to Grid: Implement snapping to grid to allow precise arrangement of components on the design surface.
- Prop Editor: Enable editing of component props via a right-hand panel.
- Code Generation: Use a tool to generate the corresponding React code for the current design.
- Code Export: Enable users to download the generated React code as a project.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#8AB4F8) to evoke creativity and trust. This color is versatile, avoiding harsh vibrancy, making it comfortable for extended use in a design environment. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), subtly desaturated (20% saturation) and bright for a clean workspace.
- Accent color: Light green (#B2F2BB), approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel, adding contrast to highlight active UI elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, line-based icons from Material UI's icon set to match the MUI component library.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with clear divisions for component library, canvas, and prop editor.
- Subtle transitions when dragging and dropping components.
